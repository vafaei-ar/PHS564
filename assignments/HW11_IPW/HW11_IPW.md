# Homework 11: IP Weighting

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. Define the **Propensity Score**.
2. Explain how IPW creates a "pseudo-population."
3. Why is it important to check the distribution of weights? What does a weight of 100 suggest?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l11_ipw.csv` dataset:
1. Estimate the propensity score for each person.
2. Check the overlap of PS between treated and untreated groups.
3. Calculate Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) for all confounders before and after weighting.
4. Estimate the IPW causal effect.

**Deliverable:** Jupyter Notebook or PDF.
