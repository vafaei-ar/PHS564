# Homework 05: DAGs and Collider Bias

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. Draw a DAG for a study where "Smoking" is the exposure, "Lung Cancer" is the outcome, and "Coffee Drinking" is a confounder.
2. In the DAG $A \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y$, what happens if we condition on $C$?
3. Define "d-separation" in your own words.

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l05_collider_bias.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the marginal Risk Difference between $A$ and $Y$.
2. Calculate the Risk Difference within the group $C=1$.
3. Explain why the result in (2) is different from (1).

**Deliverable:** Jupyter Notebook or PDF.
