# Homework 09: The Parametric G-Formula

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. List the 3 steps of the Parametric G-Formula.
2. Why do we prefer the G-formula over just looking at the regression coefficient $\beta_A$? (Hint: Think about non-linear models).
3. Why is the Bootstrap used for calculating confidence intervals in causal inference?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l08_l09_parametric.csv` dataset:
1. Manually implement the 3 steps of the G-formula (Fit, Predict, Average) to estimate the ACE.
2. (Optional/Advanced) Write a simple loop to perform the Bootstrap (e.g., 100 iterations) and calculate the 95% Confidence Interval for your ACE.
3. Compare your result to the true effect (3.5).
