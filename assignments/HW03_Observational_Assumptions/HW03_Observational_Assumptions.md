# Homework 03: Observational Studies

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. Define **Conditional Exchangeability** in your own words.
2. Give a real-world example of a violation of the **Positivity** assumption.
3. Why is **Consistency** sometimes called the "well-defined intervention" assumption?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l03_observational.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the naive difference in means (ACE).
2. Use the `standardization` helper function to adjust for `L`.
3. Compare the two results. Which one is closer to the true effect (2.0)?

**Deliverable:** A Jupyter Notebook or PDF report with your answers and code.
