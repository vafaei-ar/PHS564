# Reading Guide: Lecture 01

## Primary Source
- **Hernán & Robins, *What If*, Chapter 1.**

## Key Concepts to Extract
1. **Definition of Causal Effect:** Pay attention to how the authors define an individual causal effect versus an average causal effect.
2. **Consistency:** This is a crucial assumption. What does it mean for an intervention to be "well-defined"?
3. **Exchangeability:** This is the formal way of saying "the groups are comparable." Look for the notation $Y^a \perp A$.
4. **Nondifferential vs Differential Measurement Error:** (Optional for week 1, but keep it in mind).

## Study Questions
1. Can we ever measure an individual causal effect? Why or why not?
2. If a treatment has "multiple versions" (e.g., different doses of a drug), why does this make the causal question harder to define?
