# Homework 07: Selection Bias

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. Define **Selection Bias** in terms of DAG structures.
2. Give an example of how "Loss to Follow-up" can lead to selection bias in a clinical trial.
3. What is the main assumption required for IPCW to work?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l07_selection_bias.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the association between $A$ and `Y_obs` without any adjustment.
2. Use the `ipcw_simple` helper function to adjust for selection.
3. Compare the adjusted result to the true effect (2.0).

**Deliverable:** Jupyter Notebook or PDF.
