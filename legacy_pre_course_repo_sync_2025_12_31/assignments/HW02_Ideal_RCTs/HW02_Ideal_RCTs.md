# Homework 02: Ideal Randomized Trials

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. In an ideal RCT, why is the observed association equal to the causal effect?
2. Explain what happens if we have a very small sample size (e.g., n=10) in an RCT. Does randomization still guarantee exchangeability?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l02_ideal_rct.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the Risk Ratio (RR) for the entire population.
2. Calculate the RR stratified by the covariate `L`.
3. Use standardization to calculate the adjusted Risk Ratio.
