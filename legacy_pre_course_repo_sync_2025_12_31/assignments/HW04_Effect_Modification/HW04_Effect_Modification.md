# Homework 04: Effect Modification

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. Explain the difference between "Effect Modification" and "Confounding."
2. Why do public health researchers often prefer the additive scale (Risk Difference)?
3. Can you have interaction on the multiplicative scale but not the additive scale? Give a brief explanation.

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l04_effect_modification.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the stratum-specific RDs for $M=0$ and $M=1$.
2. Calculate the stratum-specific RRs.
3. Fit a linear regression model with an interaction term and interpret the coefficient for $A \times M$.
