# Homework 10: Instrumental Variables

## Part 1: Conceptual
1. State the 3 core assumptions for a variable to be a valid instrument.
2. In the context of a randomized trial with non-compliance, why is the "assignment to treatment" a valid instrument for the "actual treatment received"?
3. What is a "weak instrument," and why is it dangerous?

## Part 2: Coding
Using the `l10_iv.csv` dataset:
1. Calculate the Wald Estimator by hand (using means).
2. Run a 2SLS regression using the `iv_2sls` helper.
3. Compare the IV result to a naive OLS regression. Why are they different?
