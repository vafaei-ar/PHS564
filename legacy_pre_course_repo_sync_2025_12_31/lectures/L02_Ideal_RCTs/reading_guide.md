# Reading Guide: Lecture 02

## Primary Source
- **Hernán & Robins, *What If*, Chapter 2.**

## Key Concepts to Extract
1. **Exchangeability vs. Mean Exchangeability:** What is the difference?
2. **Conditional Randomization:** Why would a researcher use this?
3. **Standardization:** Make sure you follow the math for "Weighted Averages" in the example.
4. **Positivity:** Why is it necessary to have $0 < P(A=a|L=l) < 1$?

## Study Questions
1. If we randomize treatment, do we need to worry about measured confounders?
2. Can randomization fail to ensure exchangeability? (Hint: Small sample sizes).
